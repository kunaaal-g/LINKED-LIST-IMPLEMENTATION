# 🧑‍💻 CODTECH Internship - Task 2

## 📌 Task Title
**Linked List Implementation**

## 📝 Task Objective
The goal of this internship task is to create a C program that implements a **singly linked list** with the ability to:
- Insert nodes
- Delete nodes
- Traverse (display) the list

## 📚 Instructions

- ✅ Create a program to implement a **singly linked list** in C.
- ✅ Implement the following operations:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Traversal
- ✅ Ensure your code is modular, clean, and efficient.

## 🎯 Deliverable
A **C program** that demonstrates the modular and efficient implementation of a singly linked list with the required functionalities.

## 🗂️ File Structure
linked-list/ │ ├── main.c             
# Entry point of the program ├── linked_list.c        
# Implementation of linked list functions ├── linked_list.h    
# Header file with function declarations and struct definitions ├

## 🧪 Sample Operations

1. Insert a node at the beginning.
2. Insert a node at the end.
3. Delete a node by value.
4. Display the list.

## ⚙️ How to Compile

You can compile the program using `gcc`:
```bash
gcc main.c linked_list.c -o linked_list
./linked_list

## Output
